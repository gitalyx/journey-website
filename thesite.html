        <p style="text-align:left">So okay this is my jouney on coding/programing even if was starting on 2021 i was just copy and paste code so yeah not really coding the rest of the years the conding "expirence" was dissapering until 2024. So i was using linux and i have </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">some problems with vscode but after i done the problems this hapends.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left">And in 2 days from hello world to building a website how i get here. Well i found a app named mimo it's like Duolingo but for coding and i learn some importing stuff but for the site i wach a guy from youtube named fireship and i wacht html in 100 Seconds and the css in 100 Seconds oh and the javascript one the title its the same but yeah i maked the website in 2023/01/27 but i dont know javascript</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">On 01/28 i learn somethings from memo do to create a button look!</p>
        <button style="background-color:lightgreen">button</button>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I was thiking to try rust lets see if i try. When i write this i mean in 2024 i am only in 5 grade in Romania so i am writing code prety much in saturday and Sunday. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">So i was on the phone 1/30 and i wander if there is a rust book on a website and i found it was the rust book second edition of 2021 and i was done i see its good but my mom bought and will comeand it will come in the middle of February or maybe in March and now i am learning what does borrowing use and other rust things because rust its pretty complicated for a bigginer as me and rust book can be very hard to understand so yeah.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But i really lke rust but its really hard to understand and now i gonna wacht some videos to understand. Okay now i kinda understand borrowing in rust but with some small questions like i know when i create a string that string its only for me and if i want that string to be for you but now i can't have that string only you can have it. I created a rust file and i created a string named s1 with the value of hello world i created an other string named s2 being a clone of s1 and</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">i said to print both of strings and normaly the console will display hello world 2 times but no only 1 time thats why i said "i have some small questions"</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">New news i learn something new from memo do to links look i created a github account here is it!</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/gitalyx/gitalyx" style="color:lightslategrey">my github account</a>
        <p>So my mom order a rust book in 30/1 and i am writing this on my phone and in 13/2 the rust book has come and i learn like at page 10 about cargo and toml stands for "tom's  obvious minimal language" which i didn't know</p>
