        <h1 style="text-align: center;">My long journey of programming!</h1>
        <p style="text-align:left">Hey this is what i build and build across the journey</p> 
        <p style="text-align:left">So okay this is my journey on coding/programming even if was starting on 2021 i was just copying and pasting code so yeah not really coding the rest of the years the coding "experience" was disappearing until 2024. So i was using linux and i have </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">some problems with vscode but after i done the problems this hapends.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">2024/01/25 the first hello world in python.</p>
        
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitalyx/my-journey-website/main/2024-02-04T12%2028%2030%2C196339289%2B02%2000.png" alt="hello world in python">
        <p style="text-align:left">And in 2 days from hello world to building a website how i get here. Well i found a app named mimo it's like Duolingo but for coding and i learned some importing stuff but for the site, i watched a guy from youtube named Fireship and i wacht html in 100 Seconds and the css in 100 Seconds oh, and the javascript one the title its the same but yeah i maked the website in 2023/01/27 but i dont know javascript</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">On 01/28 i learned some things from memo to create a button look! </p>
        <button class="button" style="red;">Button</button>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I was thinking of trying rust lets see if i try. When i write this i mean in 2024 i am only in 5 grade in Romania so i am writing code pretty much on Saturdays and Sundays. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">So i try rust i installed on my linux laptop and i said this.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">So i was on the phone on 1/30 and i wondered if there was a rust book on a website and i found it was the rust book second edition of 2021 and i was done i saw it good but my mom bought and will come and it will come in the middle of February or maybe in March and now i am learning what does borrowing use and other rust things because rust its pretty complicated for a beginner as me and rust book can be very hard to understand so yeah.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But i really like rust but it is really hard to understand and now i going to watch some videos to understand. Okay now i kinda understand borrowing in rust but with some small questions like i know when i create a string that string is only for me and if i want that string to be for you but now i can't have that string only you can have it. I created a rust file and i created a string named s1 with the value of hello world i created another string named s2 being a clone of s1 and</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">i said to print both of strings and normaly the console will display hello world 2 times but no only 1-time that's why i said "i have some small questions"</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">New news i learned something new from memo do to links look i created a GitHub account here is it!</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/gitalyx/gitalyx" style="color:lightslategrey">my github account</a>
        <p>So my mom ordered a rust book on 30/1 and i am writing this on my phone and on 13/2 the rust book has come and i learned like at page 10 about cargo and toml stands for "Tom's  obvious minimal language" which i didn't know</p>
        <p>in 13/02/2024 i made a game in rust and i put it on GitHub but the game is alerdy compiled and the most part is in makefile and now i found about Rustlings and I exercise and if i don't know I learn from the book and now I learn easily. </p>
